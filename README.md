My Project is called 'Shred Shop' which is a shop that sells different guitar pedals. Users are able to favourite the pedals they want to purchase. I also imported a video header.

To run the project, you can clone the repository from github (https://github.com/VahanVartanian/shred-shop.git), and in the terminal, run these commands:

cd shred-shop

npm install

npm run dev


I had some trouble getting Git to sync with GitHub because the remote repo already had commits, which led to errors when I tried to push. There were also conflicts in README.md that I had to fix manually, and at one point, Git complained about large files, buffer sizes, and duplicate commits. I managed to get around these issues by pulling in changes, removing large files, and adjusting some Git settings, but it definitely took some trial and error to figure out. I ended up saving the code for each of the components and restarted from scratch so that the commits on the GitHub repository were nice and organized.
